# Benchmarks

This repository contains the source code and benchmark tests between Sisk and several other frameworks.

To run the tests, you will need to have installed and available in the environment:
- [.NET 9+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [bombardier](https://github.com/codesenberg/bombardier)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or [Bun](https://bun.com/)

Run the tests with `node run-benchmarks.js` or `bun run-benchmarks.js`. The results will be available in `/benchmark-results`.

See the result of the last run in [latest-report.md](/latest-report.md).
